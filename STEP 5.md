## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

| **Design Decision and Location**                                                        | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Utilize use cases and have domain objects mapped to them                                | Analyze the use cases defined in the architectural drivers step, such as displaying the productâ€™s name and price on an interface (UC-3) and relate them to the domain objects that exist in the system             |
| Connect the modules to its related components in the system                             | Using the frameworks specified in the design decisions, modules are able to be unit-tested and different aspects of the system are able to be connected or modified (QA-1)                                         |
| Utilize the Hibernate Framework to retrieve product information from the local database | Provides the ability to retrieve information from the local database and supports transactions (QA-5). This framework is useful for object persistence, where objects should be permanently in the database (UC-6) |
| Use the Java Swing Framework to implement the modules and user interface                                | Supports local and portable non-web user interfaces, which can be applied towards the the scanner as well as the other modules within the system to integrate the ability to start transactions (CON-4)            |
