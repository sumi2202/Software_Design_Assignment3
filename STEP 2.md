### Selected Drivers:

The goal of this iteration is to address the general architectural concern of identifying structures to support primary functionality. The following primary use cases of the system are considered:

- **UC-2:** The purchasing session is able to be canceled anytime by the cashier. This will result in products that are scanned prior by the barcode scanner to be nullified.
- **UC-3:** The productâ€™s name and price are displayed on an interface or display. This is the result of the barcode scanner successfully scanning and reading the products.
- **UC-6** The cash register holds a local database consisting of information such as its products, product name, product price, and available stock.
