## Question 2: ADD Process Iteration 2 for the Cash Register Application

Question 2 prompts students to complete the ADD Process for Iteration 2 for the previously defined cash register system that has been worked on gradually throughout the course. In applying the steps required for the second iteration, students will gain a better understanding of the ADD process as a whole, as well as how it can be applied to various real-life scenarios. The architectural drivers for this system can be found [here.](https://github.com/Jenani-N/Architectural-Patterns-and-Design-Drivers)
